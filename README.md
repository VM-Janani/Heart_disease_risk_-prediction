# Heart_disease_risk_-prediction
💓 Heart Disease Risk Prediction & Lifestyle Recommendation System
A web-based machine learning application that predicts heart disease risk using the Framingham dataset, explains the contributing features using SHAP (Explainable AI), and provides personalized lifestyle and dietary recommendations based on key health risk factors.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn – Data processing

XGBoost – Heart disease risk prediction

SHAP – Feature explainability

Streamlit – Web application framework

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualizations

📁 Dataset Description
Source: Framingham Heart Study dataset

Features: Age, cholesterol levels, BMI, blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes, etc.

Target Variable: TenYearCHD (1: High risk, 0: Low risk)
